Sadly that's where 99% of the size comes from.

# EasyPeasy

Folder is made in Documents/clippings. This is embedded in exe with bat and txt from test.
Timestamped files is made for outputs and then ONLY URLS will be clipped and saved to file.

Clipboard is erased/reset until the next url comes in. Process text with type|find or download etc.


## Breakdown

If you run the exe it's silent aka no window. BAT is blue/green currently.
I also embed the bat out of habit to avoid the need to see what, where.
Only other item is the DDL text [direct-download] URLS made while testing.

Both of those items will extract to the Documents dir into a folder named clippings.
The bat will make said dir. A timestamped file is then created and ANY URL gets saved.
The clipboard is set to auto-erase as to not spam duped lines [might change/fix laterz]

I mainly use this cause I hate the parenting of the current web which is getting worse.
Couple this with a downloader and you're good to go so just clip away and send bits to all.
I usually use rclone to push right to cloud, but wget and curl both work too. msiexec works too.





*** If you stumble upon this don't bitch at me about the exe. ***
** I've read that it'll throw some false postitives, so use the bat. **
* You'll also be able to see what URL's it's grabbing. *
